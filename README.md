# bedwars-datapack
A minecraft datapack to emulate the function of the bedwars reloaded spigot plugin

Note: This is a work in progress project. most of the features have not been implemented yet. Run at your own risk

I never got anywhere close to finishing this, and in its current state it's practically useless. If you want to untangle sphaggetti code, go ahead and fork lol
